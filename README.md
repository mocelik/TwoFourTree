# TwoFourTree
Implementation of a Two-Four Tree in C++. This is a work in progress.

Last updated: April, 2020


### Working Features
* Inserting elements
* Iterating over elements


### Desired Features
This is the order in which I plan to implement and test this container

* Inserting elements (done)
* Iterating over elements (done)
* Removing elements
* Lookup functions
* Capacity functions

Finally, I plan to write some benchmarks to compare the performance against well known data types.
